# Tableau Story for 2015 U.S. Flight Delays

## Summary

In this project, I created interactive visualizations using Tableau for U.S.
flight delays data from 2010 to 2018, which is downloaded from kaggle.
https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays/data
The purpose of my visualizations is to answer the following questions:

- First insight is explaining how the different airports have taxi delays across the country. Its easier to visualize and compare multiple airports in the map and see their details. And adding the bar chart showing a more clarity to the weekly delays based on the airports.

- Second visualization uses the bar chart which is comparing two categorical value. As it is showing how the airline and departure delays varying over the weeks in different Airlines. Also, this visualization utilizes the high data ink ratio eliminating the chart junks.

- Third visualization uses color blind palette covering all type of audiences, it also utilizes line plot to visualize the time period.

The final iteration of the visualizations
